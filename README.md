#       ----------------  Titanic Survival Exploration  ----------------

In 1912, the ship Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, we will explore a subset of the Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features and which classifier best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.

Steps
-- Downloading Datasets from kagele website
-- Do preprocessing on data 
-- Visualize relation between variables.
-- On the basis of relation found use best fit classifier to predict chances of survival.
